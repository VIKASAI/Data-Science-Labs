    "A big company wants to venture into the mobile phone business. The manufacturing of new devices is done but the company has doubts regarding the pricing of phones. It wants to make a decision based on the market trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "They don't want the exact price but they do want to know whether a phone belongs to `budget phones`(price<400 dollars) or  `flagship phones`(price>400 dollars) zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You take two important features of a smart phone namely `Battery_Power` and `Clock Speed` and decide to plot the binary targets against each other and get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/svm_graph_1.jpg)\n",

    "By plotting the same data in a higher dimension, we are able to identify a decision boundary that separates the target class\n",

    "With an analogous reasoning, it can be assumed that for data in `k` dimensions there exists `z` dimension(z>k) that `linearly` separates the target class\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what the **Support Vector Machine**(SVM) classifier attempts to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SVM?\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are based on the concept of decision planes that define decision boundaries. \n",
    "In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal `hyperplane` which can help categorize new examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperplane\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperplane is defined as a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space. \n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g: If the space is 2-D, its hyperplanes are lines(1-D) whereas if data space is 3-D then its hyperplanes are the 2-D planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our phone example, one thing you might have wondered. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**Support Vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. \n",
    "Using these support vectors, SVM maximizes the margin of the classifier.Reason for maximizing the margin distance is that it gives greater confidence for future data points to be classified correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These are the points that help us build our SVM.\n",

    "![](../images/svm_graph_6.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin for hyper-plane B is the highest \n",

    "But SVM will select Hyper-plane A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** SVM first selects the hyper-plane which classifies the classes more accurately before maximizing margin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because hyper-plane B has a classification error and hyper-plane A has none, SVM will select hyper-plane A.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the presence of an outlier, there can be two cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The outlier can be closer to the examples of other class than most of the examples of its class,thus reducing the margin.\n",
