1. How does the ensemble work?

a) It uses several machine learning models with different algorithms to improve the accuracy of prediction
b) It uses Several machine learning models with identical algorithms to improve the accuracy of prediction

* both statement a & b are false
* statement a alone is true
* both statement a & b are true
* statement b alone is true

solution: statement a alone is true

2. We have a training data is of size N. Draw random sample with replacement of size N â€“ This gives a new dataset, it might have repeated observations, We are selecting records one-at-a-time, returning each selected record back in the population, giving it a chance to be selected again.
what is this methodology?

* Bagging
* Boosting

solution: Bagging

3. Choose all those which are applicable for Boosting:

a) Time and computationally expensive
b) Easy to implement in all scenarios
c) Complexity of the classification increases

* statement a and statement b
* statement b
* statement a and c
* statement a

solution: statement a and c 

4. Where does the Multiple layers of machine learning models are placed one over another where each of the models passes their predictions to the model in the layer above it and the top layer model takes decisions based on the outputs of the models in layers below it.

* Bagging
* Boosting
* Stacking
* Averaging

Solution: Stacking

5. Ensembling helps to increase the interpretation of the business problem easily:

* True
* False
* Not applicable

Solution: False

6. 
Statement 1. Combining multiple models of same ML algorithms gives better predictions. 
Statement 2. Combining multiple predictions generated by different algorithms would give better predictions.

* Both the statements are True but depends on the type of Problem as well.
* Statements 1 is False and statement 2 is true
* Statements 2 is False and statement 1 is true
* Statement 2 alone is True

Solution: Both the statements are True but depends on the type of Problem as well.

7. Bagging helps in reducing the bias in the model
* True
* False

solution: False

8. In Boosting, we use sequential learning to corect previous models weakness?
* True
* False

Solution: True

9. Bagging of an unstable algorithm helps to stabilise and generalise the model?
* True
* False

Solution: True
 
10. Ensembles is not recommended to use when there is significant diversity among the models?
* True
* False

Solution: False
